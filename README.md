# Cyclone-Intensity-Prediction
Developed a model to predict tropical cyclone intensity using machine learning (SVM, Random Forest) and deep learning (LSTM) techniques. The project converted dataframes into a supervised learning format to predict 6hr to 72hr intensity intervals and included the creation of a web application for cyclone image visualization.
